# Analysis of Climate Change Tweets using Topic Modeling
Final Thesis of Masters for Statistics and Data Science 

This github is for coding purposes of the master thesis assigment. R and Python was used for this study.

R was used for the pre-processing and visualization part of the thesis, while Python was used given its advanced packages for the application of modeling techniques.

R was used for the descriptive analysis and pre-processing steps, while Python was used for the lemmatization, LDA modeling, Coherence measures, pyldavis intertopic distance, and distribution of topics.
